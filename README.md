# Python-Implementation-of-Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Maps-KSOM-
Welcome to this project dedicated to exploring and implementing Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps (KSOM) in Python. This repository is designed to guide you step by step through the theoretical and practical understanding of this powerful unsupervised learning tool.

For a more detailed explanation of the concepts and the code, it is recommended to read the accompanying Medium article, where I explain the KSOM algorithm in detail and provide a comprehensive guide to coding it from scratch.

Project Contents:

Introduction to Unsupervised Learning: Understand the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning and the importance of the latter in handling unlabeled data.

Overview of KSOM: Discover the history and practical applications of Kohonen maps, including their usefulness in data visualization and dimensionality reduction.

Algorithm Details: A deep dive into the steps of the KSOM algorithm, with clear mathematical formulations and illustrations to facilitate understanding.

Python Implementation: A complete guide to coding the KSOM from scratch, using the Iris dataset as an example. This includes:

Initial data visualization with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Network initialization and training with adjustable hyperparameters.
The use of the Mexican hat function for weight updates.
Visualizations of the map's weights and inferences on new samples.
Demonstrations and Visualizations: Graphs and heatmaps to illustrate how the KSOM organizes data and identifies underlying structures.

Conclusion and Future Perspectives: A summary of the advantages and limitations of KSOM, along with suggestions for improvements and future extensions.
